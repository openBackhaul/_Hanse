This repository supports building the necessary infrastructure to implement an ONF-based MW SDN.  

Infrastructure is understood to include, but is not limited to  
- Responsibilities for designing, testing, integrating, deploying and operating  
- Processes, tools and know-how  
- Contractual relationships with service and component suppliers  
- Environments for testing and production, including, for example  
  - Server or cloud environments  
  - Firewall settings  
  - Test equipment (physical and virtual)  
- ...  

This document does not provide any specific instructions on how to implement the individual aspects.  
However, it identifys necessary steps and puts them in a sensible order.  

It is recommended to structure into the following phases:
1. Getting to know the interface  
2. Igniting the application layer  
3. Integrating first applications  
4. Mounting the production
5. Connecting with the software landscape
